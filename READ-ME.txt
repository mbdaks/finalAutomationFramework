The main java file that must be run is "TestCase1.java"
Several other test cases will have a similar name. 
These files are the ones that are dependent on the particular website(here: Jetstar).
The "data.java" file contains all the initializations required for the other classes to work.
These initializations can be changed according to our needs.
Rest of the functions in the project are independent and form the main part of the framework.
